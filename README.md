# 📝 Task Tracker

A simple, sleek, and responsive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to easily manage daily tasks directly in their browser — add, complete, and remove tasks with a clean interface and smooth interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks using the input bar.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed with a custom checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Clear Completed:** Easily clear all completed tasks at once.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in your browser’s localStorage, so your list stays even after you refresh.
- **Responsive Design:** Works great on desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with custom properties and responsive styles)
- **JavaScript** (ES6+, no frameworks)

## ✨ How It Works

1. Enter your task in the input box and click "Add".
2. Click the checkbox to mark a task as complete—completed tasks appear crossed out.
3. Remove tasks using the cross button.
4. Click "Clear Completed" to remove all tasks you've finished.

All tasks are stored in your browser’s localStorage, so you won’t lose them unless you clear your browser data.
